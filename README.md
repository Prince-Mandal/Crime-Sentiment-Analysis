➡️ Project Overview

In this project, I developed tools to help solve complex crime cases. I compared two powerful statistical models - decision trees and logistic regression - to see which one could best predict important crime characteristics.

➡️ The Data

The dataset I used consisted of detailed information on hundreds of homicide cases, including victim demographics, crime scene evidence, suspect profiles, and other relevant factors. This comprehensive data allowed me to train and test my models to find the most effective approach.

↪️ The Findings

After thoroughly testing and refining both models, the decision tree approach emerged as the clear winner. It was significantly more accurate at forecasting key details about crimes compared to the logistic regression model.

✔️ Real-World Applications

These advanced analytics tools have the potential to be game-changers for law enforcement. By leveraging the power of decision trees, investigators can uncover hidden patterns and insights that were previously impossible to detect. This could lead to faster case resolution and more criminals being brought to justice.

✅ Benefits

Highly accurate predictions of homicide characteristics
User-friendly interface for easy integration with existing systems
Time-saving efficiencies that free up investigators to focus on other tasks
Improved outcomes for victims' families and the community at large.
